# Ball Shooter Game

This is a simple 2D shooter game built with HTML5 Canvas. The game features a player-controlled ball that shoots other balls. When a ball is hit, it explodes into a colorful firework display. The player earns points for each ball they hit, and the game gets progressively harder as more balls appear on the screen.

## How to Play

Use the mouse cursor to aim at the other balls and hit them to earn points. The game ends when the player ball collides with another ball or when the player reaches the maximum score.

## Technologies Used

The game was built using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of HTML5 Canvas and how to use it to create a simple 2D game. At building this game, I learned how to draw shapes, animate them, handle user input, and keep track of game state using JavaScript.
